# Alter

Alter (ALTR) is a support token for the development of a new blockchain with its namesake. Once the new blockchain is operational, ALTR tokens will be swappable for a proportional amount of native Alter coins. The blockchain aims to implement multiple consensus methods and offer a host of features centered around privacy, trust, transactional speed, capacity and security.

Details will be maintained on the https://www.alter.cash website.
The blockchain's whitepaper will be published on the same site as soon as the first stages of design are finalized.

Feature requests and suggestions are welcome!
