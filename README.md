# Alter

Alter (ALTR) is a support ERC-20 token for the development of a new blockchain with its namesake. Once the new blockchain is operational, ALTR token owners will be able to exchange their tokens with the same amount of native Alter coins.

Details will be maintained on the https://www.alter.cash website.
The blockchain's whitepaper will be published on the same site as soon as the first stages of design are finalized.

Feature requests and suggestions are welcome!
